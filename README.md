# Heart-Disease-Prediction
🫀 AI-Powered Heart Disease Prediction System
This project is a full-stack AI-based web application that predicts the presence of heart disease using both structured medical data and MRI image analysis. It integrates traditional machine learning and deep learning (CNN) for comprehensive diagnostics.![Building Heart Disease Prediction System](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5759ae36-7166-4f38-86f2-e744f784e370)


🔍 Features
✅ Clinical Data Prediction: Input-based ML model to predict heart disease using parameters like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

🧠 MRI Image Classification: Deep learning model trained to classify heart MRI scans as diseased or healthy.

📊 Interactive Dashboard: Real-time prediction results displayed with visuals and risk analysis.

📂 Image Upload Support: Drag-and-drop or file selection for MRI images.

💬 User-friendly interface with responsive design.
